## Hi there 👋

<!--
**m4ck-y/m4ck-y** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on backend development using **Python**, **Go**, and a bit of frontend with **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about **Clean Code**, **Design Patterns**, and **Hexagonal Architecture** for better project structure.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on backend development projects, especially those that involve **Python**, **Go**, and building scalable applications.  I'm also eager to work on projects related to **Data Science**, particularly with **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** for **data analysis** and **visualization**.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced machine learning algorithms, integrating data science with backend development, and optimizing PostgreSQL queries for large datasets.
- 💬 Ask me about **Python**, **SQL**, **PostgreSQL**  , **Go**, **JavaScript**, 
**TypeScript**, **Google Cloud**, or best practices for **Clean Code**, **Design Patterns**, **JWT** authentication, and **Hexagonal Architecture**.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me out **macario.alvaradohdez@gmail.com**
